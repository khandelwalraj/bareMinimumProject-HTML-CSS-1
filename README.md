# bareMinimumProject-HTML-CSS-1
A bare-minimum mini website project with only HTML &amp; CSS (Project One)

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's a way to create and structure content on a web page, like text, images, videos, and links. Think of it like the structure of a building, Just like how a building has different floors and rooms.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's used to add colors, fonts, and other visual styles to the HTML structure to make it look more appealing and interesting. Think of it like the paint and decorations on the building.

Together, HTML and CSS are the building blocks for creating websites. HTML sets up the structure and content of the website, and CSS makes it look good and attractive. They make the webpage a complete and functional entity.
